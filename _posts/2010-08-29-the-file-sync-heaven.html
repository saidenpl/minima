<p>It is very handy to be able to reach some of your files from anywhere.Â </p>
<p><a href="http://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> allows you just that. There are clients available for Mac, Windows, Linux, Android and iPhone. If that is not enough for you, you can plain upload and download your files via a web browser.</p>

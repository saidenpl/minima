<p>Its a ugly fact that I probably use my <span class="caps">HTC</span> Desire mostly for flashing alternative ROMs. I read somewhere that you can actually make calls from it (send some messages even) ;P</p>
<p>Recently I decided to give one of the ROMs from the <span class="caps">MIUI</span> family another chance.<br/>Using <span class="caps">MIUI</span> ROMs is refreshing, because they are so very different from both most <span class="caps">AOSP</span> and vendor modified ROMs. Even with UI’s like HTCs SenseUI or Samsungs TouchWiz the menus, settings and other standard pieces of the UI look somewhat similar.</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">MIUI</span> … UI looks and feels more like iOS than Android. Even the app management and icon positioning are very similar to the Apple way.</p>
<p>There are also other cool features like:</p>
<ul><li>Call and Message “Firewall” – particulary useful to get rid of those “sweet deal” calls from your<span class="caps">MNO</span></li>
<li>Call recording – another mindful feature whenever a contact center agent calls you – now you can say “hey, by the way, this call is being recorded for security reasons”</li>
<li>Built in <span class="caps">FTP </span>server</li>
<li>Some sweet looking themes</li>
</ul><p>I chose <a href="http://miuiandroid.com/community/"><span class="caps">MIUI</span> Android</a> but there are several other <span class="caps">MIUI</span> distros.</p>
<p>I highly recomend it to anyone bored with the SenseUI or the bare <span class="caps">AOSP</span> look of the interface.</p>

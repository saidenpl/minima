Just install the app and it will show you the address you need to load up in your browser and even generate a password for you.</p>
<p>The app works fine in both tethered and client WiFi mode. The list of functions includes:</p>
<ul><li>messaging</li>
<li>filesystem browsing and editing</li>
<li>contact browser</li>
<li>media browser with upload and download features</li>
</ul><p>Check out the app to learn all its features, its free and I sincerely hope it will stay free ;)</p>

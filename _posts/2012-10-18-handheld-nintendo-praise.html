<p>I really have no idea how Nintendo manages to pull this off. My 6 year old DS Lite is one of my favorite gadgets of all time(of all time! thanks Kanye). </p>
<p>Currently most smartphones have more CPU/GPU whoomp than the DS Lite, but you just can&rsquo;t beat the taste of the little Nintendo flavors that come with their handheld consoles. I don&rsquo;t know about your average DS owner but I bought mine for the content - one I won&rsquo;t be able to see on any other platform (except maybe running a DS emulator on it). </p>
<p>The games may look less eyecandish than even the previous gen PSP, but the experience is unique for me.</p>
<p>The DS is capable enough to run the kind of games that ran on the N64, 3d and all. But those are not the games I love the DS for. New Super Mario Bros, Mario Kart, the whole Pokemon shebang, the jRPGs&hellip;. ah.</p>
<p>If you want to game on the road, want to game without the need of firing up you PC or the entertainment system of your choice this is a grand toy. And if you happen to have and offspring that is starting to appreciate the fine sport of gaming, you can even have a fine excuse to get yourself a DS :D</p>
<p>- &ldquo;Daddy what are you playing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>- Pokemon, dear</p>
<p>- &ldquo;So, you gotta catch'em all?&quot; </p>
<p>Tear to my eye ;)</p>

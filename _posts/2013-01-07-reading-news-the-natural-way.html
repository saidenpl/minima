<p>I like to have my news sources aggregated when reading on my mobile devices. Up until recently my weapon of choice was <a href="https://www.pulse.me/" target="_blank">Pulse News.</a> It still is a great reader but it has become a little too bloated for my taste. After a short fling with <a href="https://www.google.com/producer/currents" target="_blank">Google Currents</a> I have found a suitable replacement for Pulse.</p>
<p><a href="http://flipboard.com/" target="_blank">Flipboard</a> is kind of similar to Pulse, in a way that it renders the news articles as &ldquo;cards&rdquo; which you can&hellip; well flip as pages in a magazine or a book. The interface is horizontal for larger screens and vertical for smaller ones. You can add many different sources as: RSS, Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr or content especially created for Flipboard.Â </p>
<p>The social and blogging adapters allow posting with pictures. In case of Twitter and Facebook they lack most of the functionality of the official clients but are enough to post a reply or a quick tweet.</p>
<p>Just like Pulse, Flipboard offers to store your settings in &ldquo;the cloud&rdquo; (boy do I dislike this term, only a little bit less then &ldquo;web 2.0&rdquo;).</p>

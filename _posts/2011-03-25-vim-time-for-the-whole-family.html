<p>The vim editor is capable of backing up things you change in several ways. Sometimes when you do not want or need to use<span class="caps">SCM</span> because the thing you are editing is too trivial, then timestamp indexed backups come in handy.</p>
<p>Here is how to do it using autocommand defined in your .vimrc:</p>
<div class="gist"><a href="https://gist.github.com/2204193">https://gist.github.com/2204193</a></div>
<p>Of course you have to have backup enabled and I would recommend setting <strong>backupdir</strong> to a fixed path to avoid doing a mess all around the filesystem.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=89">Here</a> is a slightly more refined way, but for me the first one works just fine.</p>

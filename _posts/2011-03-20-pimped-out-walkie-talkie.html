<p>The PTT or Push To Talk service somehow never &ldquo;caught&rdquo; in Poland. It showed up a long time ago, but somehow I never saw it functional in any network here.</p>
<p>I always liked the idea of instantly transferring a voice message to another mobile number. I know you can do this via MMS but the <strong>HeyTell</strong> implementation shows PTT in a whole nicer way.</p>

<p>Because the application shows where you are (if you allow it), you can discover that a friend you are talking to is in fact in the same shopping center as you.</p>
<p>Available for both Android and iOS. I Highly recommend it.</p>

<p>Okay, so you&rsquo;ve got your <a href="https://www.spotify.com">Spotify</a> premium account and are in a situation where a device able to play music better than your mobile, tablet or laptop is present.
Sadly, the device neither has a Spotify client, nor uPnP media player or AirPlay capabilities&hellip;</p>

<p>While wondering how to play music from my laptop on a <strong>Linux MPD server</strong> that serves as a jukebox I came to one simple conclusion. Stream the music.</p>

<p>I started a NetRadio and broadcasted the <code>Stereo Mix</code> from my laptop to the MPD. Voila.</p>

<p>This way you can play Spotify on a device that lacks native Spotify support, but can play Internet Radio.</p>

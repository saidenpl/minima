<p>I was writing a simple script which was supposed to dump data from MySQL to a flat file with pipe delimited values.</p>
<p>The output was supposed to be in CP-1250 encoding, but somehow the transcoding failed, stating incorrect conversion from <span class="caps">ASCII</span>-8BIT, to <span class="caps">UTF</span>-8 then to the desired encoding… <span class="caps">WTF</span> is <span class="caps">ASCII</span>-8BIT?!?!</p>
<p>I was surprised, because when I analyzed the output before transcoding it was <span class="caps">UTF</span>-8 not <span class="caps">ASCII</span>-8BIT (whatever it is). <br/>After googling I learned what I was doing wrong – I was actually using an older gem called <strong>mysql</strong> and was supposed to be using <strong>mysql2</strong> :)</p>

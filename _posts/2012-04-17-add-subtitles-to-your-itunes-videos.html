<p>There is a nice and clean way to embed subtitles to your iTunes videos without the need of transcoding the video. The program is called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/subler/">subler</a>.</p>

<p>Of course there are numerous ways you can play video with subtitles on a Mac with much less hassle, but if you for some reason want to use iTunes to play or share videos on your home network this a neat and fast way to add subtitles to your videos.</p>

<p>Besides being able to convert SRT subtitles to the 3GPP format, the software can also transcode audio (using <a href="http://www.perian.org">Perian</a>) from formats that are unwelcome inside a MP4 container (fe. AC3). Another nice addition is the possibility to add and or modify meta data inside the file (including the cover image).</p>

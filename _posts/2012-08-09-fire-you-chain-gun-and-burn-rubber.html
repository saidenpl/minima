<p>I finally got my hands on <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/108700/">Death Rally PC</a>, and what was supposed to be taking a peak at what it looks like, turned into a 4 hour gaming session :)</p>

<p>To say that I enjoyed the original would be an understatement. </p>

<p>I already logged my share of time on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.remedy.DeathRallyFREE&amp;hl=pl">mobile version of Death Rally</a>, but the PC version is significantly more fun. </p>

<p>IMHO 7,64 EUR well spent. </p>

<p>Even though the PS3 got the ability to play DivX the Video playback abilities are somewhat limited. </p>
<p>English is not my native language so I tend to watch movies subtitled. Reencoding whole movies takes a lot of time and is hardly something you would call comfortable.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://ps3mediaserver.blogspot.com/">PS3 Media Server</a> reencodes the Videos on the fly with the ability to add subtitles. </p>
<p>No you can not only view DivX, but also many other formats that the PS3 does not &ldquo;understand&rdquo;. </p>
<p>The server is pretty straightforward to setup but feel free to ask me for help.</p>

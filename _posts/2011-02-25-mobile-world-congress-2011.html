<p>Thanks to my employer <a href="http://www.materna.com.pl" title="Materna Communications">Materna Communications</a> I was able to attend the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. </p>
<p>For me, a gadget geek it was especially fun to take a peak at several nice devices.</p>
<p><strong>Samsung Galaxy S2</strong> </p>
<p>The S2 just blown my mind with the quality of its display. When I first saw it I thought it was a display model with a &ldquo;fake&rdquo; screen. Closer examination showed that the screen is indeed real and the contrast, sharpness and view angles are here to stay.</p>

<p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Tab 2</strong></p>
<p>Here I was somewhat disappointed. I liked the fist 7&quot; model better than the iPAD because I was able to use the keyboard in both portrait and landscape mode. This 10&quot; model does not allow this any more. The UI looks a little too messy for me. We will see if that is how the production model will look</p>

<p><strong>HTC Desire S</strong></p>
<p>Since I am a proud owner or its predecessor, the Desire I was glad that a pimped out model was being released. The new model got a front facing camera, more storage for apps and improved battery life - all the things that were missing from the Desire</p>
<p><strong><strike>Unnamed HTC Tablet</strike> HTC Flyer</strong></p>
<p>It looks very nice. It is yet to be seen if the Quallcomm CPU will outperform the rest of the Tegra based competition. Sadly the HTC staff did not want to show it up close&hellip;</p>

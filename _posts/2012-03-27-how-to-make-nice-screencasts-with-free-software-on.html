<p>For now I only played around with recording screencasts, because frankly anything I would like to share has already been recorded by someone else.Â </p>
<p>I have been looking for a free screen video capture tool for Mac and failed to find any that suit my needs, so I decided to use Ubuntu and <a href="http://xvidcap.sourceforge.net/">Xvidcap</a></p>
<p>I use a <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> virtual Ubuntu installation and just capture the fullscreen area. The post recording editing is done in <a href="http://fixounet.free.fr/avidemux/">Avidemux</a> which is available for Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.</p>
<p>Capture is done like this:</p>
<div class="gist"><a href="https://gist.github.com/2214318">https://gist.github.com/2214318</a></div>
<p>Then you can record audio any way that suits you, and mux it in Avidemux.</p>
<p>You can upload the video to video hosting site of your choice.</p>
<p>If you want the video to look nice on YouTube, and you are not using 720p you can persuade VirtualBox with installed guest additions to switch to YouTube&rsquo;s preferred 480p mode like so:</p>
<div class="gist"><a href="https://gist.github.com/2215598">https://gist.github.com/2215598</a></div>
<p>&hellip; or if you did not install guest additions you can do it like this, but you need to restart the virtual machine:</p>
<div class="gist"><a href="https://gist.github.com/2215608">https://gist.github.com/2215608</a></div>
<p>Here is a sample on YouTube:</p>

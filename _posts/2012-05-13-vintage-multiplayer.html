<p>I remember the times when playing a multiplayer game was not very easy.</p>
<p>During the times that DOS was the dominant home OS, most multiplayer sessions invlolved a serial cable and taking a PC to the place the gaming took part at.</p>
<p>If you were lucky enough to have access to a LAN populated by other willing players, you were one happy camper.</p>
<p>If you would like to relive those multiplayer moments with some friends from the old days, <a href="http://www.dosbox.com/">DOSBox</a> is there for you, with its <a href="http://www.dosbox.com/wiki/Connectivity">IPX emulation</a>.</p>
<p>I already tried out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Rally">Death Rally</a> and it worked like a charm.</p>
<p>Now I need to test drive Doom, Duke Nukem 3D, Mechwarrior 2 :)</p>

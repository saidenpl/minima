<p>I was wondering how hard would it be to setup Asterisk with Google Voice.</p>
<p>It seems that it is not hard at all :) </p>
<p>Using <strong>chan_gtalk</strong> and <strong>res_jabber</strong> you will be able to utilize your Google Voice account from inside your Asterisk installation, as shown in this <a href="https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/display/AST/Calling+using+Google">wiki</a> article </p>
